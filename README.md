<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

<div align="center">
  <a>
	<img src="assets/docker.webp" alt="docker logo">
  </a>
</div>
</br>
This project aims to set up a mini-infrastructure of differents services by following specific rules. It has to be carried out in a virtual machine and be launced by using ``docker-compose``
Each service will have to run in a dedicated container, and the container names have to match the service name.
They will also have teir own Dockerfile written by ourself and called in the ``docker-compose.yml`` file.
It's forbidden to use already existing images or use services like DockerHub.

We have to set up:

-   A container containing NGINX with TLSv1.2 or TLSv1.3
-   A container containing Wordpress + php-fpm
-   A container containing MariaDB
-   A volume for the database
-   A second volume for the Wordpress files
-   A `docker-network` for the containers to communicate with each other

Each container must restart in case of a crash.
Here's some details about the project:

-   Two users must be created for Wordpress, one of them must be an administrator
-   The domain name has to be configured to point to our local machine
-   This domain name must be secured with a valid SSL certificate and named `[login].42.fr`

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

Since it is a Docker project, there is few preliminary steps.

### Prerequisites

Having [Docker](https://docker.com) installed on your system and be able to run the `docker compose` command on your system
Having `sudo` privileges.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

    ```sh
    $> git clone https://github.com/Link-Wolf/Inception.git
    ```

2. Launch the project

    ```sh
    $> cd Inception
    $> make
    ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

<div align="center">
 <a>
   <img src="assets/inception.png" alt="our infrastructure">
 </a>
</div>

A few rules are implemented in the Makefile to handle the management of the docker:

-   `up`: Creates the directory used for persitence of data (if needed) and creates then starts the containers in detached mode
-   `down`: stops and deletes the containers
-   `stop`: stops the containers
-   `logs`: prints the logs of the containers
-   `clean`: Stops and delete the containers and deletes unused docker stuff
-   `fclean`: Delete absolutely everything deletable via docker
-   `re`: re-does the whole creation of containers from scratch

Once the containers are up and running, you can access the website by going to `https://[login].42.fr` (or localhost:443) and you will be redirected to the Wordpress page.
